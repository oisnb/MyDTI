And if you want to skip the long time preparation, please directly download the contact map and msa files which we already generated from [files](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rqAopf_IaH3jzFkwXObQ4i-6bUUwizCv/view). Then copy the corresponding two folders to each dataset dir. For example:  
(1) download the data.zip and unzip it.  
(2) copy two folders called "aln" and "pconsc4" from davis to the /data/davis of your repo, so do the KIBA.
